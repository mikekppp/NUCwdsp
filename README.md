# NUCwdsp
NUCwdsp is a full‚Äêfeatured signal processing library for Software Defined Radio

This is just an early start - the source code has been forked from [vu3rdd](https://github.com/vu3rdd/wdsp) and [TAPR](https://github.com/TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp).  The intent is to produce a macOS (and possibly Raspberry Pi OS) version of this library, leaving Windows behind.  The current source cited as the basis for this project works well on Windows but does not take advantage of modern macOS capabilties.
